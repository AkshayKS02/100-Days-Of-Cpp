# Day 2 - Inheritance, Polymorphism & Function Overloading

## Mini Projects Completed

1. **Animal Sounds (Polymorphism with Abstract Class)**
   - Created an abstract `Animal` class with a pure virtual function `speak()`.
   - Implemented derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` that override `speak()` with custom behavior.
   - Practiced runtime polymorphism and dynamic dispatch using base class pointers.

2. **Banking System (Inheritance & Virtual Functions)**
   - Implemented a base `Account` class with deposit/withdraw functions and virtual `DisplayTransaction()`.
   - Derived `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` with custom withdrawal rules.
   - Showcased inheritance, function overriding, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

3. **Function Overloading Calculator**
   - Implemented a `Calculator` class with overloaded `add()` functions for:
     - Integers
     - Floating point numbers
     - Strings
   - Practiced compile-time polymorphism with function overloading.

4. **Shape Area Calculator**
   - Created an abstract `Shape` class with virtual `area()` function.
   - Derived `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` classes with custom `area()` implementations.
   - Practiced polymorphism, abstraction, and using math formulas in OOP design.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Inheritance (base and derived classes).
- Function Overriding and Virtual Functions.
- Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions.
- Function Overloading (compile-time polymorphism).
- Practical application of OOP concepts in real-world style problems.

## Notes / Takeaways
- Clearer understanding of runtime vs compile-time polymorphism.
- Hands-on with abstract classes to enforce design rules.
- Designed projects that simulate real-world systems (Banking, Shapes).
- Strengthened OOP fundamentals through practice-driven learning.
