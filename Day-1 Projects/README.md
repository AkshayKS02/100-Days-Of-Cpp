# Day 1 - C++ Basics & OOP Revision

## Mini Projects Completed

1. **Complex Number Calculator**
   - Implemented a `ComplexNumber` class with real and imaginary parts.
   - Overloaded operators `+`, `-`, `*` to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.
   - Practiced using constructors, operator overloading, and object-oriented programming concepts.
   - Built a simple interactive calculator for user input complex numbers.

2. **Student Class**
   - Implemented a `Student` class with private members `roll_no`, `name`, and `marks`.
   - Used a constructor to initialize objects and a member function to display student details.
   - Practiced encapsulation and working with class objects.

3. **Rectangle Class**
   - Implemented a `Rectangle` class with private members `length` and `breadth`.
   - Created member functions `Area()` and `Perimeter()` to calculate respective values.
   - Practiced defining member functions outside the class and using object-oriented principles.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation.
- Operator Overloading (`+`, `-`, `*`) for complex numbers.
- Input/Output with `cin` and `cout`.
- Writing modular code with separate member functions.
- Revising basic arithmetic and logical operators.

## Notes / Takeaways
- Applied previously learned OOP concepts in practical programs.
- Gained confidence in designing classes and using objects.
- Built functional small projects combining theory and hands-on coding.
